# Tweet To Video

  * Display each video frame for 3 seconds

## How to Use this API

The API object take 2 input arguments. The first one is the key. And the second one is the list of user_handles that we want to get the twitter feed from. The 'keys' file is the path to the api keys of the twitter.

The 'keys' file looks like this:

The Keys can be obtained through tweepy api. In order to use this API, you need keys.

To be precise, we need to put user_handles in to a list. If we want to check only one person, still we need to put it into a list like ['Cagri_yoruk'].
